* apply gravity force to creatures (not air)

* larger / composite caves

* avoid global state

* time as an input to cppn (instead of phase/freq as output)

* use larger particles for air/water but not for creatures
  - hack LiquidFun to allow non-uniform radius



* global smell decay





* cppn mutate repeatably




# Evolution

* behavioural distance?
  - (for complex behaviours, many/all instances will be novel in some respect?)
  - OTOH: if we can group behaviours into qualitatively equivalent sets then ok.

* can run LF worlds in parallel?

* speciation

* crossover at phylogenetically-corresponding points
  - history markers?
  - topo analysis?

* record population measures over time
  - genome sizes
  - genetic diversity
  - behavioural diversity
  - genetic novelty
  - behavioural novelty


* transit serialisation


## Behaviour

(what is novelty - what to select)

* final position
  - or path

* set of locations reached

* number of plant cells eaten

* introduce predators/hazards
  - fixed motions
    - horiz / vert alternation
    - circling
    - homing - directly towards creature
