* problem: plants fall apart - fail to form elastic triads
* solution: after accretion, expand particle radius at group creation, then reduce back

* problem: air particles can be created inside a creature;
  - it is then constantly pulled back to its starting location
* problem: create can be created on top of a plant, binding to it
  - stuck
* solution: create creature outside, drop it in through one-way wall.
* alternative: force all particles in AABB away

* seed - splittable random

* avoid global state
