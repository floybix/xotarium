* perf
  - step fn in java/C?

* creature location is center over all particles (not groups)

* viz inputs to GRN cells / over time

* test response of GRNs to various inputs
  - (vs a defined reference state)




* apply gravity force to creatures (not air)

* larger / composite caves

* avoid global state

* time as an input to cppn (instead of phase/freq as output)

* use larger particles for air/water but not for creatures
  - hack LiquidFun to allow non-uniform radius



# Evolution

* behavioural distance?
  - (for complex behaviours, many/all instances will be novel in some respect?)
  - OTOH: if we can group behaviours into qualitatively equivalent sets then ok.

* can run LF worlds in parallel?

* speciation

* crossover at phylogenetically-corresponding points
  - history markers?
  - topo analysis?

* record population measures over time
  - genome sizes
  - genetic diversity
  - behavioural diversity
  - genetic novelty
  - behavioural novelty

* attach mutation parameters to individuals, and evolve them
  - initially, large mutations should be favoured; later, smaller

* transit serialisation



## Behaviour

* set of plant cells eaten

* energy balance / survival time

* coevolution of carnivores and herbivores
